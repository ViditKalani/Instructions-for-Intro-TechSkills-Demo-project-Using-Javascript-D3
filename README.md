Instructions for Intro-TechSkills-Demo project


Rationale: This is a quick and easy introductory "skills-check" submission that will be due in exactly a week 
i.e. Jan 20 at 11:59 pm. I will grade and return on Jan 21. This is to ensure that you have time to drop the course if need be 
since drop deadline is Jan 22 at noon. 

Grade: out of 10. You are required to do 10 objective tasks that check off your technical skills. Thus, there is no 
qualitative rubric per se. Either you complete the tasks successfully, or you don't. Each task is worth 1 point. If you get 
5 or below out of 10, I will strongly recommend that you drop the class as this means that you do not possess the necessary
technical background for this course. 

The 10 Things:
1. Using Javascript/D3, create 2 arrays of random, count data within the domain (1-10). Sample size of each array 
   should be 10.
2. Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation of each array and print them on the html with formatting.
3. Use these 2 arrays to define a x-axis and y-axis.
4. Build a svg-based scatterplot based on the random, count data generated in [1].
5. If I hover over any data point in said scatterplot, I should be able to see both data points i.e. 2,3 or 5,7 etc.
6. Your axes should be named appropriately. Since it's random data, come up with the most innovative names that you can 
   think of.
7. Send a pull request of this html to https://github.com/shionguha/cosc4500-advdatascience-sp19/intro-techskills-demo/
8. Html should be named as "LastName-FirstName-MUID.html".
9. Make sure your d3 source file is referenced relatively. You do not have to send the d3 source file. I will put copies on 
   the "intro-techskills-demo" folder so I can test your source code.
10. Within your html, provide a link to your own (free) github hosted html of this application. If I click on this link, it 
    should take me to the github "host" where I can see your application running. It shouldn't send me to your github source 
    code.
Notes:
1. Remember, that this is due Jan 20 at 11:59 pm. All pull requests are timestamped.
2. This is a very easy intro assignment. Once again, if you find yourself having problems with this workflow, then I highly
   encourage you to drop the class. We will be prototyping quick and dirty applications all semester so familiarity with this 
   type of coding is essential.
3. I will go over this very quickly on thursday.
4. Ask me any and all questions about this on thursday!
